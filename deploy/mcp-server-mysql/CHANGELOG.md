# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `ENABLE_PII_REDACTION` environment variable. When set to `"true"`, read-only
  query results are walked and likely PII values are replaced with shape-preserving
  partial masks (e.g. `j***@e***.com`, `***-***-0134`, `****-****-****-1111`)
  before being returned. Detection combines a built-in column-name heuristic
  (email, ssn, phone, first_name, address, credit_card, password, api_key,
  token, etc.) with regex scanning of values (email, US phone, SSN, IPv4, and
  Luhn-verified credit card numbers). Schema/table listings and write-operation
  response summaries are unaffected. Defaults to `"false"`, preserving existing
  behavior.
- `PII_EXTRA_COLUMNS` environment variable. Comma-separated, case-insensitive
  substrings appended to the built-in PII column list. Empty/whitespace entries
  are ignored to avoid a whole-row-wipe footgun. Only active when
  `ENABLE_PII_REDACTION=true`.
- `PII_EXTRA_COLUMN_PATTERNS` environment variable. Semicolon-separated
  JavaScript regex bodies (no delimiters/flags — compiled with the `i` flag)
  tested against the lowercased column name. Semicolon delimiter avoids
  ambiguity with commas inside regex character classes. Invalid patterns are
  logged and skipped, so one bad entry cannot crash the server. Only active
  when `ENABLE_PII_REDACTION=true`.
